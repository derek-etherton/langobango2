LangoBango

## Team Members:
* Alex Cavanagh
* Derek Etherton

## Application Description
LangoBango is a web-based voice recognition application that 
provides speech driven, language related challenges. Users will
be shown a series of phrases and asked to pronounce them verbally.
A score will be tallied as to how many words the speech recognizer
is able to match with the given phrase, and display a final score
at the end once all phrases have been completed.

LangoBango aims to be a more fun and whimsical way to train speech in different languages.

## Key Features (Beta)

3. Calculate user score for each phrase, and aggregate for a final score

## Additional Features (Final)
1. Mobile-first responsive design using the Bootstrap framework
2. User sign-in system that keeps track of user progress
3. Support for common phrases in multiple languages
4. Gameification aspects with meaningful difficulty scaling
5. Valid HTTPS certificate on a custom domain name (langobango.me)
