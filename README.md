## Application Description
Langobango is a web-based voice recognition application that 
provides speech driven, language related challenges. Users will
be shown a series of phrases and asked to pronounce them verbally.
A score will be tallied as to how many words the speech recognizer
is able to match with the given phrase, and display a final score
at the end once all phrases have been completed.

## Key Features (Beta)
1. Display a series of english phrases to the user (pulled from a db)
2. Recognise user speech via API and display back as text
3. Calculate user score for each phrase, and aggregate for a final score

## Additional Features (Final)
1. Improved UI with a mobile-first look using Bootstrap (responsive design)
2. User sign-in system that saves their best scores for comparison (???)
