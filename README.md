LangoBango

## Team Members:
* Alex Cavanagh
* Derek Etherton

## Application Description
LangoBango is a web-based voice recognition application that 
provides speech driven, language related challenges. Users will
be shown a series of phrases and asked to pronounce them verbally.
A score will be tallied as to how many words the speech recognizer
is able to match with the given phrase, and display a final score
at the end once all phrases have been completed.

LangoBango aims to be a more fun and whimsical way to train speech in different languages.
